"""Win-probability enrichment of the season's pbp -- the ONLY publisher of the pbp asset.

The pbp release asset has exactly one writer: this step. The build stage
(``wbb_data_build --dataset pbp``) writes the plain season parquet into the
tree and does NOT publish it; this step reads that parquet back, appends the
two WP columns, rewrites parquet/csv/rds together and uploads. ``publish.py``
refuses a pbp parquet without the WP columns, so no code path can ship an
un-enriched asset.

Why the step is separate from the pbp build: the pregame prior needs the
season's **schedule** and **team_box**, which the daily driver builds AFTER pbp
(the build order is load-bearing: pbp -> shots; schedules stamps flags from the
built pbp/team_box/player_box). So the enrichment runs once every input is in
the tree -- and reads all three inputs from the tree, never from the release
(the release pbp is the PREVIOUS run's asset by construction now).

History: between 2026-07-12 (columns verified present) and 2026-08-02 (absent
from every season) the nightly published the plain pbp and re-applied WP
afterwards, so every publish briefly stripped the columns and a failed
re-application left them stripped -- which broke the platform's
win-probability page. The 2026-08 whole-history republish then stripped every
season but the in-season ones (2024-2026 carry the columns today; 2004-2020
sampled seasons do not). Single writer + publish guard closes both windows.

Publishing goes through the normal ``io.write_dataset`` + ``publish.publish_dataset``
path so **parquet, csv and rds are all regenerated together**. Writing only the
parquet is how the formats drift: ``wehoop::load_wbb_*`` reads ``.rds`` exclusively,
so a parquet-only republish leaves every R user on un-enriched data from a
release that looks fresh. Mirrors ``mbb_data_build.wp_enrich`` in hoopR-mbb-data.
