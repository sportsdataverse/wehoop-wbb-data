"""Build the WBB model-dataset parquet for the sportsdataverse-data release tags.

Thin orchestration over the ``sportsdataverse.wbb`` compute surface, mirroring
the cfb/pwhl `*_model_publish` builders:

* :func:`build_ratings` -> one ``wbb_ratings_{season}.parquet`` per season
  (``wbb_team_ratings``: AdjO/AdjD/AdjEM/AdjTempo per team-season).
* :func:`build_player_value` -> one ``wbb_player_value_{season}.parquet`` per
  season (``wbb_box_bpm``: per-player-season box Plus/Minus).

Both compute fns load the released ESPN inputs themselves (schedule + team
boxscores / player boxscores), so the builder needs no local data tree and is
GH-Actions friendly.
